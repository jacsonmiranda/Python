The draft also seems to be deeper with WR, there's a number that should be left in the second round.

I agree. I've always been one to defend the players even when everyone starts proclaiming 'bad pick', but I just can't wrap my head around this one. Not only do we have needs for once, but he is a complete project that we could have gotten 10 spots lower
